    <h1>Uday Lingampalli</h1>
    <p>Hi! My name is Uday Lingampalli. I am currently doing a major in Data Science with a minor in Cognitive Science. In my free time, I like playing video games and browsing Youtube.
        The most interesting thing I learned from this lab was how to create visualizations using data and D3.

        I can't search in the bar and then click a pie slice at the same time because only the most recent query takes effect when this happens, and the filtered projects only consider the input of the said most recent query. In order to fix this, we would have to rewrite both filtered projects functions to consider the other query event as well. I fixed this bug, as you can see in this video later.
